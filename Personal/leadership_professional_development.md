### Goal Setting and Roadmaps (SMART Examples)

- **Strategic abilities & vision:** Build a 12-18 month technical roadmap within six months; secure 80% stakeholder consensus; invest two hours weekly in research.
- **Leading by example:** Champion code quality, follow standards, perform thorough reviews, target a 15% drop in critical QA bugs, and join at least five code reviews per week.
- **People leadership & communication:** Foster psychological safety, delegate significant tasks with clear expectations, and gather feedback on growth.

### Effective Communication

    Leader->>Audience: SO WHAT - Why it matters now
    Leader->>Audience: NOW WHAT - Immediate next step
```

- Prefer strategic messaging over purely informational updates.
- Structure messages using **BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front):** state the core message (**WHAT**), explain its importance (**SO WHAT**), and clarify the next step (**NOW WHAT**).

### Meeting and Conflict Management

- Open with agendas and notes so attendees arrive prepared.
- Summarize dense information; watch for groupthink and practice active listening.
- Offer context by considering the other person’s perspective ahead of time.
