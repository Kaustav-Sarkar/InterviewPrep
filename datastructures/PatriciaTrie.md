### Patricia Trie

#### Definition & core idea
Concise definition and the intuition behind the structure.

#### Time–space complexity
| Operation | Average | Worst | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insert | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Delete | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Search/Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |

#### Real-world use-cases
- Add concrete scenarios where this excels (systems, apps, infra).

#### When to choose over alternatives
- Guidance on trade-offs vs. neighboring structures.

#### Implementations
- Native: [Python](../python/native/patricia_trie.py), [Java](../java/native/PatriciaTrie.java)
- Std-lib–based: [Python](../python/stdlib/patricia_trie_std.py), [Java](../java/stdlib/PatriciaTrieStd.java)

#### Practice scenarios & interview-style questions
- Autocomplete and prefix search.
- Spell-check with edit distance pruning.
- Word break with dictionary prefixes.
- Longest common prefix among words.
- IP routing prefix matching (Patricia).
- Ternary search tree for memory-efficient dictionary.
