### Array

#### Definition & core idea
Concise definition and the intuition behind the structure.

#### Time–space complexity
| Operation | Average | Worst | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insert | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Delete | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Search/Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |

#### Real-world use-cases
- Add concrete scenarios where this excels (systems, apps, infra).

#### When to choose over alternatives
- Guidance on trade-offs vs. neighboring structures.

#### Implementations
- Native: [Python](../python/native/array.py), [Java](../java/native/Array.java)
- Std-lib–based: [Python](../python/stdlib/array_std.py), [Java](../java/stdlib/ArrayStd.java)

#### Practice scenarios & interview-style questions
- Two-sum and k-sum with sorting/two-pointers.
- Maximum subarray (Kadane).
- Prefix sums for range sum queries.
- Move zeros in-place maintaining order.
- Rotate array by k steps in-place.
- Merge overlapping intervals after sorting.
- Remove duplicates from sorted array.
- Dutch National Flag (3-way partition).
- Find kth element via quickselect.
- Sliding window for fixed-size averages.
