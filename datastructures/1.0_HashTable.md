### Hash Table

#### Definition & core idea
Concise definition and the intuition behind the structure.

#### Time–space complexity
| Operation | Average | Worst | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insert | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Delete | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Search/Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |

#### Real-world use-cases
- Add concrete scenarios where this excels (systems, apps, infra).

#### When to choose over alternatives
- Guidance on trade-offs vs. neighboring structures.

#### Implementations
- Native: [Python](../python/native/hash_table.py), [Java](../java/native/HashTable.java)
- Std-lib–based: [Python](../python/stdlib/hash_table_std.py), [Java](../java/stdlib/HashTableStd.java)

#### Practice scenarios & interview-style questions
- Group anagrams with signature hashing.
- Two-sum using hash set/map.
- First unique character index.
- Frequency counting and bucket grouping.
- LRU index map for O(1) updates.
- Design multimap for one-to-many relationships.
- Implement symbol table for interpreter.
- Deduplicate stream items.
