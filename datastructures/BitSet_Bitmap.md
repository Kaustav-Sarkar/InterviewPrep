### Bit Set Bitmap

#### Definition & core idea
Concise definition and the intuition behind the structure.

#### Time–space complexity
| Operation | Average | Worst | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insert | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Delete | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Search/Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |

#### Real-world use-cases
- Add concrete scenarios where this excels (systems, apps, infra).

#### When to choose over alternatives
- Guidance on trade-offs vs. neighboring structures.

#### Implementations
- Native: [Python](../python/native/bit_set_bitmap.py), [Java](../java/native/BitSetBitmap.java)
- Std-lib–based: [Python](../python/stdlib/bit_set_bitmap_std.py), [Java](../java/stdlib/BitSetBitmapStd.java)

#### Practice scenarios & interview-style questions
- Design a data structure supporting required operations efficiently.
- Choose appropriate structure for access/update patterns.
- Trade-offs among time, space, and implementation complexity.
- Optimize for streaming vs batch workloads.
- Scale to large N with appropriate representation.
- Memory locality and cache-aware considerations.
- Concurrency implications and safe iteration.
- Debugging invariants and test strategies.
