### Priority Queue Binary Heap

#### Definition & core idea
Concise definition and the intuition behind the structure.

#### Time–space complexity
| Operation | Average | Worst | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insert | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Delete | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Search/Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |

#### Real-world use-cases
- Add concrete scenarios where this excels (systems, apps, infra).

#### When to choose over alternatives
- Guidance on trade-offs vs. neighboring structures.

#### Implementations
- Native: [Python](../python/native/priority_queue_binary_heap.py), [Java](../java/native/PriorityQueueBinaryHeap.java)
- Std-lib–based: [Python](../python/stdlib/priority_queue_binary_heap_std.py), [Java](../java/stdlib/PriorityQueueBinaryHeapStd.java)

#### Practice scenarios & interview-style questions
- Find kth largest/smallest in stream.
- Merge k sorted lists.
- Task scheduler based on priority.
- Maintain median of a stream (two heaps).
- Top-k frequent elements with min-heap.
- Online interval scheduling with PQ.

- See curated notes in `../docs/`.
