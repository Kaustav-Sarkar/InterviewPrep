### Splay Tree

#### Definition & core idea
Concise definition and the intuition behind the structure.

#### Time–space complexity
| Operation | Average | Worst | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insert | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Delete | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Search/Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |

#### Real-world use-cases
- Add concrete scenarios where this excels (systems, apps, infra).

#### When to choose over alternatives
- Guidance on trade-offs vs. neighboring structures.

#### Implementations
- Native: [Python](../python/native/splay_tree.py), [Java](../java/native/SplayTree.java)
- Std-lib–based: [Python](../python/stdlib/splay_tree_std.py), [Java](../java/stdlib/SplayTreeStd.java)

#### Practice scenarios & interview-style questions
- Maintain ordered map/set with guaranteed log-time ops.
- Order statistics: kth element/rank queries.
- Interval indexing with treap priorities.
- Self-adjusting access patterns (splay).
- Randomized balancing for simple code (treap).
- Persistent versions via path-copying (conceptual).

#### Further reading
- See curated notes in `../docs/`.
