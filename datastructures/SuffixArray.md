### Suffix Array

#### Definition & core idea
Concise definition and the intuition behind the structure.

#### Time–space complexity
| Operation | Average | Worst | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insert | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Delete | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Search/Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |

#### Real-world use-cases
- Add concrete scenarios where this excels (systems, apps, infra).

#### When to choose over alternatives
- Guidance on trade-offs vs. neighboring structures.

#### Implementations
- Native: [Python](../python/native/suffix_array.py), [Java](../java/native/SuffixArray.java)
- Std-lib–based: [Python](../python/stdlib/suffix_array_std.py), [Java](../java/stdlib/SuffixArrayStd.java)

#### Practice scenarios & interview-style questions
- Substring search (pattern occurs?)
- Count distinct substrings.
- Number of different substrings repeated at least twice.
- Longest repeated substring.
- Longest common substring among strings.
- Lexicographic suffix order for indexing.

- See curated notes in `../docs/`.
