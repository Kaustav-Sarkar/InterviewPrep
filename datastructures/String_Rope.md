### String Rope

#### Definition & core idea
Concise definition and the intuition behind the structure.

#### Time–space complexity
| Operation | Average | Worst | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insert | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Delete | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Search/Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |

#### Real-world use-cases
- Add concrete scenarios where this excels (systems, apps, infra).

#### When to choose over alternatives
- Guidance on trade-offs vs. neighboring structures.

#### Implementations
- Native: [Python](../python/native/string_rope.py), [Java](../java/native/StringRope.java)
- Std-lib–based: [Python](../python/stdlib/string_rope_std.py), [Java](../java/stdlib/StringRopeStd.java)

#### Practice scenarios & interview-style questions
- Efficient insert/delete in large text buffers.
- Concatenate many strings without quadratic blowup.
- Subsequence splicing and substring operations.
- Text editor gap/rope trade-offs.
- Undo/redo via persistent ropes.

#### Further reading
- See curated notes in `../docs/`.
