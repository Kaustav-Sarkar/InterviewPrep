### Binary Search Tree

#### Definition & core idea
Concise definition and the intuition behind the structure.

#### Time–space complexity
| Operation | Average | Worst | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insert | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Delete | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Search/Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |

#### Real-world use-cases
- Add concrete scenarios where this excels (systems, apps, infra).

#### When to choose over alternatives
- Guidance on trade-offs vs. neighboring structures.

#### Implementations
- Native: [Python](../python/native/binary_search_tree.py), [Java](../java/native/BinarySearchTree.java)
- Std-lib–based: [Python](../python/stdlib/binary_search_tree_std.py), [Java](../java/stdlib/BinarySearchTreeStd.java)

#### Practice scenarios & interview-style questions
- Inorder traversal to get sorted order in BST.
- Validate BST property.
- Lowest common ancestor in BST.
- Compute tree height, diameter.
- Serialize/deserialize binary tree.
- Check symmetry and balanced height.

#### Further reading
- See curated notes in `../docs/`.
