### L R U Cache

#### Definition & core idea
Concise definition and the intuition behind the structure.

#### Time–space complexity
| Operation | Average | Worst | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insert | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Delete | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Search/Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |

#### Real-world use-cases
- Add concrete scenarios where this excels (systems, apps, infra).

#### When to choose over alternatives
- Guidance on trade-offs vs. neighboring structures.

#### Implementations
- Native: [Python](../python/native/l_r_u_cache.py), [Java](../java/native/LRUCache.java)
- Std-lib–based: [Python](../python/stdlib/l_r_u_cache_std.py), [Java](../java/stdlib/LRUCacheStd.java)

#### Practice scenarios & interview-style questions
- Design LRU/LFU cache for key-value store.
- Page replacement simulation.
- API rate limiters with TTL-like eviction.
- Database buffer pool policy comparison.
- Image thumbnail cache.

#### Further reading
- See curated notes in `../docs/`.
