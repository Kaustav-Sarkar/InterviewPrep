### Linked List Singly

#### Definition & core idea
Concise definition and the intuition behind the structure.

#### Time–space complexity
| Operation | Average | Worst | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insert | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Delete | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Search/Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |

#### Real-world use-cases
- Add concrete scenarios where this excels (systems, apps, infra).

#### When to choose over alternatives
- Guidance on trade-offs vs. neighboring structures.

#### Implementations
- Native: [Python](../python/native/linked_list_singly.py), [Java](../java/native/LinkedListSingly.java)
- Std-lib–based: [Python](../python/stdlib/linked_list_singly_std.py), [Java](../java/stdlib/LinkedListSinglyStd.java)

#### Practice scenarios & interview-style questions
- Reverse a singly linked list (iterative/recursive).
- Detect cycle (Floyd’s) and find entry point.
- Merge two sorted linked lists.
- Remove Nth node from end (two pointers).
- Copy list with random pointer (hash map).
- LRU cache node splicing with doubly linked list.
- Palindrome check using slow/fast pointers.
- Partition list by pivot (stable).

- See curated notes in `../docs/`.
