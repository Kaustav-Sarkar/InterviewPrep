### Circular Queue

#### Definition & core idea
Concise definition and the intuition behind the structure.

#### Time–space complexity
| Operation | Average | Worst | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insert | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Delete | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Search/Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |

#### Real-world use-cases
- Add concrete scenarios where this excels (systems, apps, infra).

#### When to choose over alternatives
- Guidance on trade-offs vs. neighboring structures.

#### Implementations
- Native: [Python](../python/native/circular_queue.py), [Java](../java/native/CircularQueue.java)
- Std-lib–based: [Python](../python/stdlib/circular_queue_std.py), [Java](../java/stdlib/CircularQueueStd.java)

#### Practice scenarios & interview-style questions
- Implement stack using two queues or queue using two stacks.
- Sliding window maximum with deque (monotonic).
- Round-robin scheduling with circular queue.
- Level-order traversal (BFS) of a tree.
- Producer–consumer buffer with circular buffer.
- Rate limiting/token bucket queueing.

- See curated notes in `../docs/`.
