### Disjoint Set Union Find

#### Definition & core idea
Concise definition and the intuition behind the structure.

#### Time–space complexity
| Operation | Average | Worst | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insert | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Delete | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Search/Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |

#### Real-world use-cases
- Add concrete scenarios where this excels (systems, apps, infra).

#### When to choose over alternatives
- Guidance on trade-offs vs. neighboring structures.

#### Implementations
- Native: [Python](../python/native/disjoint_set_union_find.py), [Java](../java/native/DisjointSetUnionFind.java)
- Std-lib–based: [Python](../python/stdlib/disjoint_set_union_find_std.py), [Java](../java/stdlib/DisjointSetUnionFindStd.java)

#### Practice scenarios & interview-style questions
- Count connected components dynamically.
- Kruskal’s MST union operations.
- Detect cycles while adding edges.
- Merge accounts (emails/users).
- Percolation connectivity in grids.

#### Further reading
- See curated notes in `../docs/`.
