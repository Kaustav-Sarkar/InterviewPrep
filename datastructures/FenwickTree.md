### Fenwick Tree

#### Definition & core idea
Concise definition and the intuition behind the structure.

#### Time–space complexity
| Operation | Average | Worst | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insert | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Delete | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Search/Access | TBD | TBD | TBD |

#### Real-world use-cases
- Add concrete scenarios where this excels (systems, apps, infra).

#### When to choose over alternatives
- Guidance on trade-offs vs. neighboring structures.

#### Implementations
- Native: [Python](../python/native/fenwick_tree.py), [Java](../java/native/FenwickTree.java)
- Std-lib–based: [Python](../python/stdlib/fenwick_tree_std.py), [Java](../java/stdlib/FenwickTreeStd.java)

#### Practice scenarios & interview-style questions
- Range sum query with point updates (Fenwick).
- Range min/max with segment tree.
- Lazy propagation for range add/assign.
- RMQ via sparse table (static array).
- 2D BIT/segment tree for grids.
- Kth order statistics in range (augmented).

- See curated notes in `../docs/`.
