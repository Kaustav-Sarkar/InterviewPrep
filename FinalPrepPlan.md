# Final SDE2 Preparation Plan (Tailored)

> Target: Interview-ready in ~6 weeks after foundation sprint; holistic 6-month plan. Constraints honored: 3.5h/day (weekdays) = 2h DSA + 1.5h courses; weekends 2h/day recap. Start smaller System Design/LLD courses first; prioritize practice; behavioral prep before portfolio.

## Total Estimated Effort

- **DSA**: 32 Easy ≈ 10.0h + 95 Medium × 0.67h ≈ 63.3h + 64 Hard × 1.0h = 64.0h → ≈ 137.3h
- **Courses** (including AWS study time): ≈ 84.7h
- **Core total** (DSA + courses): ≈ 222.0h

## Courses To Finish

- [ ] AWS Certification (Associate)
- [ ] Kubernetes Certified Application Developer (CKAD) – 17h16m
- [ ] Istio Hands-On for Kubernetes – 13h33m
- [ ] Microservices: Designing Highly Scalable Systems – 1h16m
- [ ] Mastering the System Design Interview – 5h13m
- [ ] Low Level System Design, Design Patterns & SOLID – 8h52m (Low Level, SOLID)
- [ ] Master System Design and Design Pattern – 11h32m

## Weekend (Sat/Sun) Recap Suggestions (each week)

- [ ] Re-solve 3 prior mistakes (timer: 20m each)
- [ ] Flash-review notes (patterns, templates)
- [ ] Read 1–2 short articles: Google SRE, cache strategies, consistency
- [ ] Optional: 1 short SD prompt (15–20m outline)

## Weekend Fundamentals Rotation (each week, 2h/day)

- Week A (OOP Advanced): Design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Observer), SOLID, DI, immutability, cohesion/coupling; implement 2 patterns from scratch.
- Week B (Java Advanced): Concurrency (threads, executors, futures, locks), memory model, GC tuning basics; write producer–consumer with bounded queue.
- Week C (Operating Systems): Processes/threads, scheduling, deadlocks, paging vs. segmentation, copy-on-write, filesystems; walk through context switch timeline.
- Week D (Networking): TCP handshake & teardown, congestion control, HTTP/1.1 vs 2 vs 3, gRPC, load balancing, backpressure; design retry/timeouts/exponential backoff.
- Rotate A→B→C→D. If a mock exposes gaps, swap the upcoming rotation accordingly.

## Blind Spots Guardrails (integrated across weeks)

- **Concurrency/Threading**: revisit mutex vs. lock-free; producer–consumer; async patterns
- **Database Optimization**: indexing strategies; query plans; denormalization trade-offs
- **Network Protocols**: TCP basics; HTTP/2; gRPC; backpressure
- **Security**: authn/authz, OWASP Top 10; secrets and key rotation
Focus first on interview readiness (Weeks 3–8), then expand depth and portfolio. Iterate weekly based on mock feedback and tighten communication under pressure.
