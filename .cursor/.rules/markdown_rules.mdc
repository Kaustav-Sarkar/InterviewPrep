# Template: `<Topic Name>`

## TL;DR Snapshot

- Capture the essence in 3-5 bullets; highlight definition, why it matters, and the most critical metric or fact.
- Include a single sentence risk/pitfall call-out if there is a widely known gotcha.

## Context & Triggers

- Describe when to reach for the topic: common initiators, prerequisites, adjacent concepts.
- Summarize advantages, trade-offs, and pitfalls; prefer comparative language (vs. alternatives).
- List 3-5 canonical use cases or anti-patterns as sub-bullets where helpful.

## Deep Dive

- Arrange major sub-topics with `###` headings (architecture, workflow, internals, etc.).
- Under each, add explanatory text, key equations, or tables. Keep paragraphs short (≤4 sentences).
- Call out operational thresholds, scale limits, or design constraints.

## Scenarios & Playbooks

- Provide 3-5 detailed scenarios spanning typical, edge, and failure cases.
- For each scenario include: triggering conditions, recommended approach, expected outcomes, and follow-up checks.
- Link to relevant sections in the same file using intra-doc anchors when useful.

## Visual Aids

- Integrate 2-5 Mermaid diagrams distributed near the concepts they explain; fall back to this section if placement is unclear.
- Prefer variety (flowchart, sequence, state, class, timeline, entity-relationship) suited to the concept.
- Validate syntax against official Mermaid docs; keep diagrams concise and labeled.
- Optional: embed external images (stored in `images/` alongside the markdown) with captions.

    B -->|Option 2| D[Alternate Outcome]
```

## Operational Guidance

- Document runbooks, alert thresholds, deployment tips, security/privacy guardrails.
- Provide shell commands, config snippets, or checklists as fenced code blocks where relevant.
- Highlight monitoring/observability signals and escalation paths.

## References & Further Study

- Curate 4-6 high-quality links (official docs, seminal talks, trusted blogs, academic papers).
- Annotate each link with a one-line takeaway; prefer recent sources unless the topic is foundational.
- Optionally add related internal notes or cross-link to other files in this repository.
