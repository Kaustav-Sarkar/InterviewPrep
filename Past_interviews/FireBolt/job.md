About the team

We are the Firebolt Engines team, responsible for production experience of our Engines, the core of Firebolt experience. Engines are how we define the workload a customer runs, and ultimately orchestrates all of the infrastructure to enable customers to execute their queries. This is a high impact team that gets an opportunity to collaborate with all parts of the company from the customer facing experiences to the core database teams and infrastructure.



About the role

We are looking for a skilled engineer to help build our next-generation Engines infrastructure. Your mission will be to bring the Firebolt experience to customers wherever they are, delivering cutting-edge speed while upholding the highest standards of reliability. A key strategic initiative for this role will be helping Firebolt expand its cloud data warehouse services to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure, building on our existing AWS foundation.



This is a hybrid role that merges software engineering with core site reliability engineering (SRE) responsibilities. You wonâ€™t just operate the system; you'll write the code that builds, maintains, and scales it. You will help build and operate our dynamic compute infrastructure, driving improvements in scalability, performance, and operational excellence across a multi-cloud environment. As part of a team that owns both the development and reliability of our production systems, you will play a crucial part in incident response, observability, and ensuring service quality as we grow.



About the day to day

Design and implement systematic improvements to Firebolt cloud infrastructure and Engine provisioning services to make it fast, reliable, scalable and cost efficient.
Collaborate with development teams across the company to improve services reliability, scalability and developer productivity.
Together with an engineering team, you will share an on-call rotation and be an escalation contact for service and cloud infrastructure incidents.
