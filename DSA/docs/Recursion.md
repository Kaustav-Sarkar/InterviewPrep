# Mindset to solve a recusrive function

* When you see a function that breaks into smaller subproblems, its a good candidate for recursion
* Try to think of the most basic problem, what if the array is empty or has 1 value down to the lowest possible case. Every other case is built on top of these
* Play around with a few examples and visualize
* Write code by combining recursive pattern with base case

From personal experience recursion is much easier when you use a pen and paper code just works.
